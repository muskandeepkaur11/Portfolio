            Introduction
Hello! My name is Muskandeep Kaur, and I'm a passionate web developer and designer with a deep love for creating visually appealing and user-friendly websites. With a strong foundation in interactive media design, I strive to blend creativity with functionality in all my projects.

Over the course of my education and personal projects, I have developed a diverse skill set that includes:

HTML & CSS: Crafting clean, semantic, and responsive web pages.
JavaScript: Adding interactivity and dynamic functionality to websites.
Bootstrap: Utilizing the framework to create responsive and mobile-first designs.
UX/UI Design: Designing intuitive and engaging user interfaces.
Version Control: Using Git and GitHub for version control and collaboration.
Accessibility: Ensuring websites are accessible to all users, including those with disabilities.
Experience
Throughout my academic journey, I have worked on numerous projects that have allowed me to apply my skills in real-world scenarios. Some highlights include:

Adidas Web Portfolio: A comprehensive portfolio showcasing Adidas projects, built with Bootstrap and customized CSS.

Philosophy
I believe that a great website is one that not only looks beautiful but also provides a seamless and enjoyable user experience. My approach to web development is user-centric, ensuring that every design decision is made with the end-user in mind.

Future Goals
As I continue to grow and evolve as a web developer, my goal is to stay at the forefront of web technologies and trends. I am committed to lifelong learning and continually improving my skills to create innovative and impactful web solutions.

Personal Interests
